/**
 * Typed, validated environment access -- the single place `process.env` is read.
 *
 * Every other module imports from here instead of touching `process.env`
 * directly, so a missing or malformed var fails loudly at first access with a
 * clear message naming the var and the doc, rather than surfacing as a
 * broken-at-runtime symptom (an empty image base shipping a site with dead
 * <picture> srcsets, a missing DATABASE_URL throwing deep in a query).
 *
 * Kept dependency-free on purpose: this is a handful of vars for a solo-dev
 * project, so a ~zero-cost hand-rolled reader beats pulling in a schema library
 * (zod / t3-env) and its lock-in. The upgrade path, if validation grows, is to
 * swap this module's internals for @t3-oss/env-nextjs without changing callers.
 *
 * Server vs client: only NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars are readable in the browser bundle,
 * so `clientEnv` holds those and `serverEnv` holds the secrets. Importing
 * `serverEnv` from a client component is a build-time error (it reads secret
 * vars that aren't inlined), which is the desired guard.
 *
 * The DB/image scripts (db:seed, db:images) run outside Next and only need a
 * subset; each var is validated lazily on read, so a script that never touches
 * R2 won't be forced to supply R2 creds.

 * `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL`. Next inlines client env vars at
 * build time by textually replacing exactly that literal form -- a dynamic
 * `process.env[name]` (as the `required()` helper uses) is NOT inlined, so it
 * would read `undefined` in the browser bundle and throw at hydration. Keep
 * this literal; do not route it through the helper.
