/**
 * Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) config -- Google sign-in gated to the maintainer roster.
 *
 * Login is allowed only for emails in the `maintainers` DB table (see
 * lib/maintainers.ts). The roster is seeded with sg85207@gmail.com as root and
 * is editable from the /admin panel, so access can change without a redeploy.
 *
 * Env vars (see .env.example):
 *   AUTH_SECRET, AUTH_GOOGLE_ID, AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET
 *
 * Auth.js auto-reads AUTH_GOOGLE_ID / AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET for the Google
 * provider, so no explicit clientId/clientSecret wiring is needed.
