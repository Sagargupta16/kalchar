/**
 * PigmentWash -- a soft radial-gradient backdrop in the current
 * `--section-accent`, painted into the top of a section's <main>. Each
 * route already sets its own pigment (marigold / pichwai / vermillion /
 * peacock / ruby), so dropping <PigmentWash /> as the first child of
 * <main> tints that page's chrome without touching the global ground.
 *
 * Two stacked gradients: one large warm dome at the top centre, and a
 * smaller off-axis bloom on the right. Both ride at very low opacity
 * (mix-blend lifted, ~6-10%) so the wash reads as ambient pigment
 * presence rather than a coloured panel. No JS, no animation -- pure
 * CSS via inline gradients.
 *
 * `intensity` lets a route opt into a stronger wash; default is the
 * recommended subtle setting for the home page chrome.
