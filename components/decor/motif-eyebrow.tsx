/**
 * MotifEyebrow -- the small label that sits above every page H1, refreshed.
 *
 * The previous treatment was `<rule> <number?> <eyebrow text>`, where
 * `<rule>` was a 1px line in `--section-accent`. This swaps the rule for
 * a folk-art motif glyph -- fish, lotus, mirror, etc. -- in the same
 * pigment, drawing in once when scrolled into view via Motion's
 * `pathLength` primitive (animates `stroke-dashoffset`). One painterly
 * detail per section header without rebuilding the eyebrow contract.
 *
 * Reduced-motion: skips the path-draw and renders the motif at full
 * stroke immediately. The glyph itself is the same shape either way.
 *
 * `centered` flips justification for the home-page About teaser, which
 * centres its eyebrow.
