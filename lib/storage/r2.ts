/**
 * Cloudflare R2 client for artwork image uploads (Phase 2 admin).
 *
 * R2 is S3-API-compatible, so we use the AWS S3 SDK pointed at the R2 endpoint.
 * R2 has no egress fees, which is why it's preferred over S3 for serving a
 * public image catalog.
 *
 * Server-only -- holds the R2 access keys. Called from admin server actions /
 * the migration script, never from a client component.
 *
 * The public URL of an uploaded object is `${R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/${key}`. That
 * base feeds art-image.tsx's <picture> srcset; the variant-generation step
 * (sharp -> -400/-800/-1200/-1600 .avif/.webp/.jpg) writes sibling keys under
 * the same prefix, preserving the existing filename contract.
