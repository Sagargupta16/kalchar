/**
 * Multi-photo event uploads: stage everything, process in parallel, commit once.
 *
 * Each photo is several seconds of variant encoding, so a batch inside one
 * action overran the 60 second function budget. The browser stages every master
 * straight to R2, then calls processEventPhoto for a few photos at a time (each
 * call is its own function invocation, so they run in parallel) and finally
 * hands the finished key-bases to createEvent or attachEventPhotos in one
 * ordered write. Sequencing lives in lib/event-photo-batch.ts (pure, tested);
 * this file only wires it to the form data and the server actions. The create
 * form passes the `files` React state as the `images` entries, so anything the
 * strip removed or reordered is what gets staged.
