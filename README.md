## Content

All display data lives in two JSON files:

- [`src/data/site.json`](src/data/site.json) -- brand, nav, contact, sections, workshops.
- [`src/data/artworks.json`](src/data/artworks.json) -- artwork catalog. One entry per piece. Image filename references [`public/artworks/`](public/artworks/).

Adding a new artwork: drop the image into `public/artworks/<slug>.jpg`, append an entry to `artworks.json`. The site picks it up automatically.
