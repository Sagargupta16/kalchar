/**
 * The one place that knows which routes render which entity.
 *
 * Every admin mutation ends by refreshing the pages that show the data it just
 * changed. Until this module, those lists lived as seven hand-written helpers
 * spread over five action files (66 call sites). Adding a public page that reads
 * testimonials meant hunting down every helper that should now include it, and a
 * typo in a path failed silently: revalidatePath("/wrok") is a no-op, not an
 * error.
 *
 * Here each entity maps to its consumers once. Adding a consumer is a one-line
 * change in this file, and the `Entity` union turns a misspelt entity into a
 * type error. New consumers belong in this registry and the route coverage
 * checks in lib/revalidate.test.ts.
 *
 * Consumers, from the lib/data imports under app/ (update both when adding a page):
 *   /               artworks, categories, workshops, events, testimonials, profile
 *   /work           artworks, categories
 *   /work/[slug]    artworks, testimonials
 *   /custom-orders  artworks, categories, orderPresets
 *   /events         events
 *   /workshops      workshops
 *   /about          profile, artworks, workshops
 *   /catalog.csv    artworks (category names arrive on the artwork rows)
 *   /sitemap.xml    artworks (slugs only, so a category rename does not touch it)
 *   /admin/...      the matching admin manager
