/**
 * Reveal -- a fade-up wrapper used across home + page sections.
 *
 * The first time the element enters the viewport, it fades in and lifts
 * 16px. Subsequent scrolls don't replay (`once: true`). When the user has
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, Motion's library-level handling (configured by
 * <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"> in the root layout) skips transitions
 * and renders the final state -- we don't branch on a hook value here
 * because doing so produces a different React tree shape on server vs.
 * client and breaks hydration.
 *
 * `delayMs` is the entry delay (ms). Use in lists for a small stagger
 * (e.g. `delayMs={index * 60}`).
