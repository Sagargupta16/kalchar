## Project

Portfolio site for **Megha Seth**, traditional folk artist (family member of Sagar). Live at <https://kalchar.co.in/>.

The full project knowledge (goal, confirmed decisions, vision, architecture) lives in [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md); the full system picture is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (entry point to the [docs suite](docs/README.md): DATABASE, AUTH, IMAGES, DEPLOYMENT, DEVELOPMENT). Read both at session start.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript strict + Tailwind 4 + Biome 2. Motion 12 + Lenis (lazy-loaded) for animation. shadcn-style components (cva + Radix-friendly). pnpm 10, Node 22.

Dynamic Next app on **Vercel**: public pages static/SSG, `/admin` + `/api` server-rendered. **Neon Postgres** (Drizzle) for catalog, **Cloudflare R2** for images, **Auth.js v5 + Google** for admin login (allowlist in the `maintainers` table). The earlier static-export-to-GitHub-Pages setup is retired (the deploy.yml Pages workflow is manual-only break-glass).

## Branch + deploy

Active work lands on `dev`, ahead of `main`; feature branches (`fix/*`, `feat/*`) PR into `dev`. `main` -> Vercel production -> kalchar.co.in; `dev` -> Vercel preview. Only `main` + `dev` deploy (Ignored Build Step on the Vercel project). Push + PR only when Sagar says so. `main` is branch-protected (PR + passing CI required).

DNS at GoDaddy: `@` A -> `76.76.21.21`, `www` CNAME -> `cname.vercel-dns.com`.

## Local dev

```sh
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000  (needs .env.local for DB/R2/auth)
pnpm build        # next build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format
# DB/images:  pnpm db:push | db:seed | db:images
```

`devIndicators: false` is set in `next.config.mjs` (the in-app DevTools panel was crashing HMR on Windows + pnpm; kept off as a dev-stability flag). Secrets live in `.env.local` (gitignored); the contract is in `.env.example`.

## Project rules

### Style and copy

- **No double dash (` -- `) in user-facing copy.** Replace with comma, period, colon, parentheses, or restructure. The Em-dash visual idea is fine in content writing but the literal `--` glyph is banned in metadata, JSX strings, page bodies, dropdown options, and `data/*.json`. Internal code comments and JSDoc may keep `--` since they don't ship.
- **No emojis** in user-facing copy or commits unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Voice**: neutral first-person plural ("we'll get back to you"), not third-person referencing the artist by name. Exception: `data/site.json` artist-voice copy, where the artist speaks in first-person singular and we don't rewrite her words.

### Visual / motion

- **Mobile-first.** Most traffic arrives from WhatsApp / Instagram link-taps. Design for phone width primarily, then scale up.
- **Refined motion.** Fade-up reveal on scroll, subtle hover lifts, smooth scroll, character-entrance on hero. Bespoke animation on the work itself is allowed: 3D card tilt, organic watercolor backdrops (ink-splash / pigment-wash), gold-leaf shimmer. **Banned: busy mesh / lattice / particle / game-like ornaments, and a custom cursor (use the native pointer).** All animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, handled at the library level via `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`, plus an explicit `usePrefersReducedMotion()` gate for anything Motion's config can't reach (raw `useSpring` transforms, animated SVG `rx/ry` attributes). **MEMORY.md "Motion exclusions" is the source of truth for this policy; if the two disagree, MEMORY.md wins.**
- **Subtle, consistent corner radius** (`rounded-md`) on every surface (cards, panels, fields, buttons, image plates). Pills + theme toggle stay `rounded-full`. No sharp corners.
- **Section pigment accents**: about=marigold, workshops=pichwai, custom-orders=vermillion, contact=peacock. Hero + Selected Work inherit the global terracotta. Set via `--section-accent` inline on `<main>` or a `Section` wrapper.
- **No raw hex / rgb in components.** All color via CSS custom properties. Lone exception: `data/artworks.json` palette arrays (data, not theme) and SVG data URIs (CSS vars don't resolve there).
- **No magic timings.** Use named tokens (`--duration-fast/base/slow`, `--ease-out-soft/glide/spring`).

### Architecture

- **Data seam at `lib/data.ts`.** Everything reads the catalog through it -- async Drizzle queries against Neon. `getSite()` stays sync (reads `data/site.json`, the static chrome). Don't query the DB or import `data/*.json` directly outside this file. Events read via `getAllEvents`/`getRecentEvents`/`getEventById`; singleton site settings (artist photo, home-intro toggle) via `getSetting<T>(key)`.
- **Store is a filter, not a table.** The shop is the "Available to buy" lens over `artworks` (priced + `status !== "sold"`) on the `/work` ("Artwork") page -- no products table. Sold pieces keep a badge in the gallery and drop out of the buy filter.
- **Events are their own entity.** `events` rows hold an ordered `images` array of R2 key-bases (first = cover); multi-image galleries with a "+N more" lightbox. The `processImageVariants` core in `process-artwork-image.ts` is shared by artworks (`artworks/<slug>`) and events (`events/<id>/<imageId>`); don't duplicate the sharp/R2 loop.
- **Images via `lib/image-base.ts`.** `ARTWORK_IMAGE_BASE` = R2 public URL + `/artworks`; `IMAGE_ORIGIN` = the bare R2 origin (events store full key-bases). The gallery `<picture>` srcset, lightbox, and OG metadata read it. `ResponsiveImage` is the generic `<picture>` primitive; `ArtImage` wraps it. Admin uploads go through `lib/storage/process-artwork-image.ts` (sharp -> R2).
- **Admin mutations as server actions**: catalog/roster in `app/admin/actions.ts`, events + profile settings in `app/admin/event-actions.ts`, shared sync helpers (incl. `requireMaintainer`) in `app/admin/_helpers.ts`. Every action re-checks the maintainer session before touching Neon/R2.
- **URLs from one place.** `lib/site-config.ts` exports `siteConfig.url` / `prodUrl`.
- **500-line file ceiling.** Split before committing: extract sub-component, lift styles, pull data into JSON.
- **Data files at repo root** (`data/`). Not under `src/`.

### Workflow

- **Never push to remote without explicit per-session approval.** Rebasing local feature branches autonomously is fine.
- **One open PR at a time per target.** Bot PRs (Renovate, ImgBot) count.
- **Default branch is `main`.** Never `master`.
- **Never force-push to `main`. Never amend published commits. Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`).**
- **Update `CHANGELOG.md` on every PR.** Add a new top entry under a chosen version number (no `[Unreleased]` placeholder), and bump `package.json` `version` to match. Versioning: pre-1.0.0 patch (`0.x.Y`) for typo / link / image swap / new artwork, minor (`0.X.0`) for new section / content-model change / stack swap, major (`X.0.0`) reserved until after 1.0.0 (first public launch). On merge to `main`, tag the merge commit (`git tag v0.X.Y`) and push the tag.

## Operating mode

The user drives discovery and decisions. Don't propose stacks, scopes, or design choices unprompted. When they signal "go" or "do it", execute against their stated intent without re-litigating earlier decisions.
