/**
 * Where artwork image variants are served from.
 *
 * Images live in Cloudflare R2 under `artworks/<slug>-<width>.<ext>` (AVIF /
 * WebP / JPG at 400/800/1200/1600 + a master-width JPG). The admin upload flow
 * (lib/storage/process-artwork-image.ts) writes them; the public gallery reads
 * them from the bucket's public URL.
 *
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix: art-image.tsx is a client component, so this value must
 * ship to the browser. It's a public URL, not a secret. Set
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL in every environment (Vercel prod + preview, CI,
 * and local .env.local).
 *
 * Read through `clientEnv`, which throws if the var is unset or not a URL --
 * so a misconfigured environment fails the build loudly here instead of the
 * old silent `?? ""` that shipped a site with dead <picture> srcsets.
