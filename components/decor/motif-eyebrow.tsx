/**
 * MotifEyebrow -- the small label that sits above every page H1, refreshed.
 *
 * The previous treatment was `<rule> <number?> <eyebrow text>`, where
 * `<rule>` was a 1px line in `--section-accent`. This swaps the rule for
 * a folk-art motif glyph -- fish, lotus, mirror, etc. -- in the same
 * pigment, drawing in once when scrolled into view via Motion's
 * `pathLength` primitive (animates `stroke-dashoffset`). One painterly
 * detail per section header without rebuilding the eyebrow contract.
 *
 * Reduced-motion: handled globally by `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`
 * in `MotionProvider`. We don't branch the `initial` value locally because
 * `useReducedMotion` returns `null` during SSR and the real preference
 * after hydration -- that mismatch produced a hydration error on routes
 * where the eyebrow rendered above the fold.
 *
 * `centered` flips justification for the home-page About teaser, which
 * centres its eyebrow.
