/**
 * Character-by-character entrance for the hero lead.
 *
 * Each character renders as a span; on mount the spans fade up in
 * sequence. `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` from the root layout
 * automatically suppresses the animation when the user prefers reduced
 * motion -- no per-component branching needed.
 *
 * Restraint: characters animate over a small distance (8px) and fast
 * (300ms each) with a small per-character delay (8ms) so the total
 * lands inside ~1s for a typical 80-char description. Anything more
 * theatrical than this reads as an intro animation, not a flourish.
