/**
 * Process an uploaded artwork image into the full responsive variant set, then
 * upload all variants to R2 under `artworks/<slug>...`. Server-only (sharp +
 * R2 keys). Shared by the admin upload action and the `pnpm db:images` script.
 *
 * Output keys match the ARTWORK_IMAGE_BASE contract exactly:
 *   artworks/<slug>-<w>.avif|webp|jpg  (w in 400/800/1200/1600)
 *   artworks/<slug>.jpg                (mozjpeg fallback, long edge capped at 2000 px)
 * so the gallery's <picture> srcset resolves with no per-image bookkeeping.
 *
 * Returns the natural aspect ratio (width/height) of the source so the caller
 * can store it on the artwork row for layout.
