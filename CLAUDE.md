## Project

Portfolio website for **Megha Seth**, traditional artist. Owned, self-hosted, eventually under her own domain.

Aesthetic: warm light / dark / editorial / classical -- artwork-forward, italic display serif, generous whitespace, single warm accent sampled from the work.

## Stack

Locked 2026-05-17. Frontend-only, static deploy.

- **Astro 6** -- zero JS by default, ships React islands only where interactivity is needed.
- **React 19 + TypeScript** -- TSX for interactive components (theme toggle, gallery filter, future lightbox). Project-wide TS strict mode via `astro/tsconfigs/strict`.
- **Tailwind 4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Theme tokens defined with `@theme` in [`src/styles/globals.css`](src/styles/globals.css). Light/dark via `class="dark"` on `<html>`.
- **Self-hosted fonts** -- Cormorant Garamond (display serif, italic-forward), Inter (body), Tiro Devanagari Hindi (accent). All via `@fontsource(-variable)`. No Google Fonts CDN call.
- **JSON-driven content** -- single source of truth in [`src/data/site.json`](src/data/site.json) (brand, nav, sections, workshops) and [`src/data/artworks.json`](src/data/artworks.json) (artwork catalog). Loaded via Astro content collections in [`src/content.config.ts`](src/content.config.ts). Same model survives a future CMS or backend swap.

Backend hooks left as inert seams (contact form, workshop booking) -- to be activated when needed without restructuring.

## Memory

Read [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md) at session start, alongside the workspace-root files in the stacking preamble. It holds repo-specific facts: client role, locked decisions, pending decisions (linked to the new-artwork skill), and the content inventory.

Update `MEMORY.md` when:

- A locked decision changes (e.g. domain registered, hosting migrated, stack swapped).
- A client-facing role or policy fact changes (rare).

The catalog [`src/data/artworks.json`](src/data/artworks.json) is the source of truth for artwork count, titles, slugs, and styles -- never duplicate that into MEMORY.md.

Never put PII in `MEMORY.md`. Contact details, payment terms, and anything sensitive stay out of the repo entirely.

## Run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # local dev server
pnpm build        # static build to ./dist
pnpm preview      # serve the built site
pnpm typecheck    # astro check (TS + .astro)
```

Local URL: `http://localhost:4321/folk-art-portfolio/` (subpath matches the GH Pages base).

## Test

Build + typecheck are the current quality gates. Playwright smoke test and Lighthouse CI to be added before public launch.

## Deploy

GitHub Pages from this repo (`Sagargupta16/folk-art-portfolio`). `astro.config.mjs` is preconfigured with `site: 'https://Sagargupta16.github.io'` and `base: '/folk-art-portfolio/'`. Live at <https://sagargupta16.github.io/folk-art-portfolio/>. When the artist's custom domain lands, drop `base` and update `site`.

## Entry points

- [`src/pages/index.astro`](src/pages/index.astro) -- single-page site composing the section components.
- [`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) -- HTML shell, theme script, header/footer.
- [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts) -- typed re-exports from `src/data/site.json` (brand, nav, contact, styles, sections).

## Key files

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md), [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), [`README.md`](README.md) -- meta files at repo root.
- [`src/data/site.json`](src/data/site.json) -- brand, nav, contact, all section copy, workshops list.
- [`src/data/artworks.json`](src/data/artworks.json) -- artwork catalog (one entry per piece).
- [`src/components/layout/`](src/components/layout/) -- `Header`, `Footer`, `Section` wrapper, `ThemeScript`, `RevealController`.
- [`src/components/sections/`](src/components/sections/) -- `Hero`, `About`, `Work`, `Workshops`, `Contact`. One per page section.
- [`src/components/ui/`](src/components/ui/) -- React TSX islands. `ThemeToggle`, `Gallery`. Reach for an island only when interactivity is required.
- [`src/content.config.ts`](src/content.config.ts) -- Zod schemas for the JSON-loaded `artworks` and `workshops` collections.
- [`src/lib/images.ts`](src/lib/images.ts) -- `artworkUrl(art, baseUrl)` helper for building public image URLs.
- [`src/lib/placeholder.ts`](src/lib/placeholder.ts) -- deterministic SVG placeholders per style (used as fallback if a piece has no `image`).
- [`src/styles/globals.css`](src/styles/globals.css) -- Tailwind import, theme tokens, font imports, design-system utilities.
- [`public/artworks/`](public/artworks/) -- one `<slug>.jpg` per piece. Astro generates AVIF + WebP at build.
- [`.claude/skills/new-artwork/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/new-artwork/SKILL.md) -- recurring task: add a new artwork.

## Component conventions

- **Astro components** for everything that doesn't need client-side state (sections, layout, simple lists).
- **React TSX islands** only for interactive UI (theme toggle, filtering, lightboxes). Hydrate with the narrowest directive (`client:visible` > `client:idle` > `client:load`).
- **Path alias** `@/*` -> `src/*`. Always import via the alias, not relative climbs.
- **Theme tokens** referenced as `var(--color-*)` in Tailwind classes (`text-[var(--color-ink)]`). Do not hardcode hex.
- **One section per file** under `src/components/sections/`. The page composes them in order.

## Gotchas

- Client (Megha) does not write code. Update flow is Sagar edits and ships -- no CMS yet. If she ever wants self-edit, the JSON-driven catalog is CMS-ready (Decap, Sanity, etc.) without restructuring.
- Domain: client wants their own. Registrar / DNS not yet decided -- site is on `Sagargupta16.github.io/folk-art-portfolio/` until then. When DNS lands, drop `base` and set the custom `site` in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Adding a new artwork: drop `<slug>.jpg` into [`public/artworks/`](public/artworks/), append an entry to [`src/data/artworks.json`](src/data/artworks.json) with matching `image: "<slug>.jpg"`. The site picks it up automatically.

## Branching and releases

- **No direct push to `main`.** Always work on a feature branch (`feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>`). Don't push the branch to remote until Sagar explicitly says so ("push it", "push and PR", etc.). Treat `main` as protected even if server-side branch protection isn't configured yet.
- **PRs only.** All changes land in `main` via PR. No fast-forward merges from local.
- **One open PR at a time.** Don't open a second PR while one is unmerged. Stack additional changes onto the existing branch. Exception: a true hotfix on a separate branch, with the existing PR linked in the new PR body.
- **Versioning: SemVer, manual, pre-1.0.0** while the site is in build-out. 1.0.0 = first public launch on the client's domain.
  - **Patch** (`0.x.Y`): typo, broken link, image swap, CSS tweak, new artwork added.
  - **Minor** (`0.X.0`): new gallery section / page, content model change, stack swap.
  - **Major** (`X.0.0`): reserved -- only after 1.0.0 ships.
- **Always version. No `[Unreleased]`.** Every PR opens with a chosen version number in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). On merge to `main`, that version becomes a release -- tag the merge commit (`git tag v1.1.0`) and push the tag. No floating drafts; the changelog always reflects what's in `main`.

## Tech posture

- **Latest stable everything.** Greenfield client work, no legacy users -- use the newest stable versions of languages, runtimes, frameworks, and libraries. No "safe but old" pins unless there's a documented constraint (browser support, hosting limit, etc.).
- **Modern syntax and APIs.** Latest ECMAScript / Python / whichever lands in the stack. No deprecated APIs. Prefer the newest idiomatic patterns over older ones, even when both work.

## Repo-specific rules

- This is **client work**, not a personal project. Voice in copy = the artist's voice, not Sagar's. Don't apply Sagar's voice principles to anything user-facing.
- Image rights are cleared (confirmed 2026-05-17). Hosting and using artwork imagery in this repo is fine.
- **500-line file ceiling.** No source file (`.astro`, `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.css`, `.json`) may exceed 500 lines. If you hit the limit, split before committing -- extract a sub-component, lift styles to `globals.css`, or pull data into JSON. Generated/lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `dist/**`) are exempt. Bumping the ceiling is a real decision; don't.
